# :yin_yang: Design Principles :yin_yang:

### Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same.

### Program to an interface, not an implementation.

### Favor composition over inheritance

### Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.

### Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

### Depend upon abstractions. Do no depend upon concrete classes.

### Principle of Least Knowledge: talk only to your immediate friends

### The Hollywood Principle: Don't call us, we'll call you.

### A class should have only one reason to change.

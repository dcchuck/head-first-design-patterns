# Head First Design Patterns

A typescript implementation.

## Design Principles

* `Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same.`
* `Program to an interface, not an implementation.` - `Program to an interface really means program to a super type.`
* `Favor composition over inheritance`
* `Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.`

## Patterns

```
The Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

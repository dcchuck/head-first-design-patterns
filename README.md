## :yin_yang: Design Principles :yin_yang:

#### Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same.

#### Program to an interface, not an implementation.

#### Favor composition over inheritance

#### Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.

#### Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

#### Depend upon abstractions. Do no depend upon concrete classes.

#### Principle of Least Knowledge: talk only to your immediate friends

#### The Hollywood Principle: Don't call us, we'll call you.

#### A class should have only one reason to change.

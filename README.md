# Head First Design Patterns

**Head First Design Patterns** is a book that introduces a collection of design patterns and principles using humurous images and code written in [Java](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/language/index.html). This respository contains code demonstrating these patterns other languages.

## :yin_yang: Design Principles :yin_yang:

#### Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same.

#### Program to an interface, not an implementation.

#### Favor composition over inheritance

#### Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.

#### Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

#### Depend upon abstractions. Do no depend upon concrete classes.

#### Principle of Least Knowledge: talk only to your immediate friends

#### The Hollywood Principle: Don't call us, we'll call you.

#### A class should have only one reason to change.

## The Book

The text is a very approachable introduction to design patterns. If you have any Java experience, or are even just comfortable reading code and willing to learn a little, I recommend it.
